Summary: March Third

This morning I did a few JavaScript exercises and added some content to my Free Code Camp tribute page project. I changed the structure a bit. Learning a little more about [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap.com") rows and col widths. I started a new course on Udemy by Colt Steele, [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview "Colt Steele"). I hate
names like that but I have seen some good reviews. I also tested my Python knowledge by seeing if I could
still code a "FizzBuzz" challenge.
