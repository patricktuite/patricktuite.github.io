Summary: Pelican blog to document learning

I am starting this little blog to give me a space to document what I am currently learning about and force me to update Github everyday. Today I learned about Pelican a static site generator. I was able to successfully deploy this post by creating a virtual environment with conda and installing Pelican. I did the quick-install and several blog post and walkthroughs were extremely helpful in my understanding and execution. I also worked on some basic Javascript including intializing variables.
